# GBA Emulator Compilation Build Scripts

Modern Python3 builder scripts to replace the original Windows 32bit applications bundled with the following Gameboy Advance emulators:
- PocketNES for Nintendo NES (by Loopy, Jan 2001?)
- PCEAdvance for PC Engine (by FluBBa, Apr 2003)
- Goomba for the original Gameboy (by FluBBa, Oct 2003)
- SMSAdvance for SEGA Game Gear, Master System, SG-1000 (by FluBBa, Jul 2005)
- Cologne for ColecoVision (by FluBBa, Jan 2006)
- MSXAdvance for MSX-1 (by FluBBa, Mar 2006)
- NGPAdvance for Neo Geo Pocket/NGP Color (by Flubba, Jul 2008)

The scripts combine the emulator binary with the game ROMs and their required metadata. Although on many operating systems Python scripts don't support drag and drop operations, you can drag and drop multiple file selections onto the shell window in which you are preparing the command line. This makes these scripts nicely usable for building large compilations.

Each script has help information accessible via the -h command line option.
